# NLP_CoD_Case

Individual Project investigating fan engagement in the Call of Duty ESL s a part of the Text Analytics and Natural Language Processing (NLP) - DAT-5317 course by Edward Kwartler. 

## Files & Task
The project required utilizing the methods and techniques acquired in the course. I focused my analysis on the presence of "toxic" culture in gaming and the attitude towards sponsors (sponsor appeal). 

### 1) Data Cleaning 
The first R script contains all the required data cleaning and preparation code. The raw data link can be found below. The output is a cleaned dataset - the amount of tweets sampled in cleaning can be changed. The default in this upload is 10%. The analysis conducted utilized all tweets.
